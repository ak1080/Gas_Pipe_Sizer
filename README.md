Program computes the maximum flow of gas (cubic feet per hour) on standard metallic pipe sizes. The 2021 Uniform Plumbing Code lists two equations from NFPA that the tables are based on. There is a low pressure equation for when inlet pressure is less than 1.5 psi and a high pressure equation for when pressure is over 1.5 psi. The constants Cr and Y depend on if the chosen gas is natural gas or propane. The table generated by the code is intended to size gas pipe using either The Longest Length Method, or the Branch Length Method.
